This note presents an overview of the files, primarily contained in the folder Data Sources/UK Traffic Statistics, which is relevant for the presentation of rail way, road and waterborne freight.
Waterborne covers movements on rivers and inlands waterways.

############################################# Drawback #############################################

The drawback of these statistics is that it isn't location specific but general for the entire UK.

############################################# Rail way #############################################

Rai0401.ods presents national railways freight moved by commodity, with historical data going back to 2000.
"By commodity" means on the following groups: (Coal, Metals, Construction,	Oil and petroleum,	International,	Domestic intermodal,	Other,	Total,	Infrastructure)

"Moved" means that the unit is in tonne-kilometres, i.e. expressed in terms of weight and distance transported, and not in value as the data for ports/airports, used as layers.

Rai0402.ods present national railways freight lifted by commodity, with historical data going back to 2000.
"By commodity" means on the following groups: (Coal, Other, Total)

"Lifted" means that the unit is in tonne, and therefore expressed the weight transported, and not the value as it was the case with ports/airports, mentioned above.

############################################# Road #############################################

rfs0101.ods present freight moved, lifted and kilometres covered for heavy-goods (HG) vehicles registrered in GB, with historical data going back to 1990.
rfs0104.ods/rfs0105.ods/rfs0106.ods presents freight moved and lifted by commodity, with the data involving quite an extensive groups of goods. Historical data is available.
rfs0130.ods present a summary of domestic and international road freight activity, and historical data is available.
rfs0204.ods/rfs0205.ods/rfs0206.ods/rfs0207.ods presents exports carried by HG vehicles, both by country and commodity.

############################################# Waterborne #############################################

tsgb0508 (port0701).ods present historical data on goods lifted/moved by traffic type with "traffic type" being: Internal, Coastwise, Foreign, One-ports.
tsgb0510 (port0704).ods present historical data on goods lifted by specific waterways (mainly rivers).

############################################# Conclusion #############################################

All three presents different interesting opportunities. To some extent, I think that the data on freight flows via railways and roads gives the same opportunities, namely to highlight the individual
networks on the map, and present some statistics on the accompanying cards.
Differently, I believe that the data on waterborne freight flows allow us to make a layer using the data and part of the OS MasterMap.
