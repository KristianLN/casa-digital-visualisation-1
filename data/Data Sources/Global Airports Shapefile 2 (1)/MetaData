	humoperatedby character varying(25): Airport used for humanitarian flights operated by... UNHAS, ASF... List of names separated by "," or "-"
	locprecision character varying(25): Precision of the location
			Accurate => GPS coordinates, digitized from an high resolution satellite imagery or a detailled map (accuracy at the street level)
			Approximate => Precision which is not below the city/town level. It often corresponds to a point equivalent at the point of the city/town/village
			Bad => Feature with a very low precision. A feature exists in 1 area (province, region...) but we don't know where exactly, the reference (settlement) is impossible to find and the point is put randomly
			Unknown => No information regarding the precision
	latitude numeric(8,5): Latitude of the point (Calculated automatically from the geometry)
	longitude numeric(8,5): Longitude of the point (Calculated automatically from the geometry)
	iso3 character varying(5): ISO3 code of the country where the feature is located. This field is calculated automatically at the database level with the bnd_adm0_a_ungiwg_2012 layer
	iso3_op character varying(25): List of ISO3 code (separated with a character '-' or ','). Use to quickly filter the data for the features of interest for 1 operation. 1 feature could be located in 1 country but be an asset for the operation of another country (for example an office delocalized for security reason in the neighbor country or a warehouse used for storage for several countries). Exceptionnally, it happens that the code do not refer to an iso3 code of a country but to the name of an operation (Ebola, Haiyan...)
	country character varying(50): Name of the country where the feature is located. This field is calculated automatically at the database level with the bnd_adm0_a_ungiwg_2012 layer
	lastcheckdate timestamp without time zone: Date of the last check of all (or a part) of the attributes. The date has to be specified manually during the edits
	remarks character varying(1000): Notes/Description/Remarks - The user is free to enter any information that is necessary but cannot be stored in the others fields
	url_lca character varying(254): Reference to the LCA page of the feature
	source character varying(254): Source of the information. It could be the source of the geometry or the source of the main attributes. Several sources can be accepted for the same feature(list of names)
	createdate timestamp without time zone: Date when the feature has been created. Calculated automatically at the database level while saving (commit) the edits.
	updatedate timestamp without time zone: Date of the last update. Calculated automatically at the database level while saving (commit) the edits. Different of the lastcheckdate because the user can forget to specify the date manually or because sometimes we can do a quick edit (for example change the status or correct misspelling) without checking all attributes.
	geonameid integer: geonameid of the closest village/town from the geonames database
	shape geometry: Geometry
