# Summary

I know there are others of these out there, but this is really my first attempt at modeling anything from scratch to finish.  I don't have a 3D printer.  If you do, and you want to try it out, go for it.  I'd LOVE to see someone see if this meets their expectations.  Please let me know.

BTW, it's upside down.  It's in this orientation because it'll probably print better because of the stack pins on the bottom.  I tried to make it "stackable".  If anyone prints two, lemme know how the tolerances are.  

Another thing I did was make it in pieces.  Each of the six surfaces can be ungrouped, printed separately and theoretically assembled.  I don't know if those properties carried through from Tinkercad to Thingiverse.  Anyway, this could allow for a very quick SLA print if all the sides are laid out side by side.  

This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0JQuM4H0RQf
